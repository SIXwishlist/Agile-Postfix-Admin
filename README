Postfix Virtual Mailserver uses database to read information about users and domains. Typically MySQL would have
four tables. However with some clever selects the same information can be stored in a single table. 

This project contains the Postfix files for configuring of your mailserver to use a single-mysql table and web
interface written on agile toolkit which allows three level access - for regular users, domain admins and superadmins.
